1. Hot Nodes Optimization
Current State:

2 nodes | 56GB heap (28GB/node) | 6TB storage (3TB/node)

3000+ shards (1500+ shards/node)

25% CPU | 65% memory usage

Issues:

Excessive shard count: Each node holds ~1,500 shards, far exceeding the recommended 20-25 shards per GB of heap (28GB/node ⇒ 560-700 shards/node max).

Risk of instability: High shard density increases overhead for tasks like searches, indexing, and recovery.

Recommendations:

Reduce shard count:

Merge small indices (e.g., daily indices into weekly/monthly).

Use ILM (Index Lifecycle Management) to force merge indices in the warm phase.

Adjust index.number_of_shards for new indices (avoid over-sharding).

Scale horizontally: Add 2 more hot nodes to distribute shards (~750 shards/node).

Check replicas: If replicas (index.number_of_replicas) are enabled, reduce them temporarily (e.g., from 1 to 0) to halve shard count.

2. Cold Nodes Optimization
Current State:

2 nodes | 50GB heap (25GB/node) | 20TB storage (10TB/node)

3600+ shards (~1,800 shards/node)

4% CPU | 63% memory

Issues:

Shard overload: ~1,800 shards/node exceeds the recommended 500-625 shards/node (25GB heap).

Underutilized resources: CPU/memory are low, but shard overhead still risks instability.

Recommendations:

Force merge read-only indices: Reduce shards by merging segments (e.g., _forcemerge?max_num_segments=1).

Add nodes: Add 1-2 cold nodes to lower shard density.

Verify ILM policies: Ensure older indices are shrunk (using ILM’s shrink action) before moving to cold tier.

3. Frozen Tier Optimization
Current State:

1 node | 6GB heap | 14TB storage

3000 shards | 10% CPU | 35% memory

Issues:

Single point of failure: No redundancy for frozen data.

High shard count: While frozen tiers use searchable snapshots, 3,000 shards may slow mount operations.

Recommendations:

Add 1-2 frozen nodes: Improve redundancy and distribute shard mounting load.

Use ILM to freeze older indices: Automate transitions from cold to frozen tier.

Use lower-cost storage: If using AWS/EBS or Azure, consider cold HDD storage for frozen data.

4. General Improvements
Heap Settings:

Keep heap ≤ 26GB/node (to avoid garbage collection issues). Your current heap sizes are safe.

Set -Xmx and -Xms to equal values (prevents heap resizing).

Monitor JVM metrics: Watch for frequent/long GC pauses (indicate heap pressure).

Index Templates: Enforce shard size limits (e.g., 10-50GB/shard) in templates.

Disable unused features: For cold/frozen tiers, disable _source or use best_compression.

Scaling Summary
Tier	Action	Expected Outcome
Hot	Add 2 nodes + reduce shards	~750 shards/node, stable performance
Cold	Add 1 node + force merge	~1,200 shards/node, lower overhead
Frozen	Add 1 node + optimize storage	Redundancy + cost savings
