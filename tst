ONETim Application Monitoring:

Current Steps: Login, Order Status, Order Detail, Order Details Tabs, Logout

Proposed Enhancement:

Login Step

OneSuite Homepage

Order Status Page

Order Number Search

Order Details Page

To implement these enhancements, we anticipate a brief downtime of up to 5 minutes. We plan to schedule this work during off-business hours on a Saturday or Sunday to minimize any impact.

Please let me know if you approve of these changes or if you have any questions or concerns regarding the proposed enhancement.

Thank you for your consideration.
