There is a need to build dashboards and alerts in Elastic using Salesforce event data. Many important EventLogFile (ELF) types and real-time streams require the paid Salesforce Shield add-on. Elastic Observabilityâ€™s preferred ingestion and telemetry workflows assume access to Shield-level event data. Without Shield, our visibility into frontend performance, component errors, and real-time security signals is limited.

Solution

Use all freely available Salesforce objects/events (Login/Logout, Lightning Usage, API totals, Apex unexpected exceptions, etc.).

Built a Python ingestor to pull, normalize, and bulk-index those events into Elasticsearch.

Created Kibana dashboards and alerts for sessions, page performance, API usage, and errors.

Kept the pipeline modular to add Shield event types later and added compensations (RUM/synthetics) for gaps.
